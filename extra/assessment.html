        <h2>On-site Assessment / Site Survey Charge</h2>
        <p class="small-note">Why we charge a assessment charge.</p>

        <h3>Short version</h3>
        <p>
         We charge a $75 on-site assessment fee to cover the time and expertise it takes to do a proper survey of your location. 
         This isn’t a quick chat or sales pitch – we drive out to you and spend 20 minutes to an hour walking through your space to understand exactly what you need. 
         During this visit, we inspect your current setup, look at where devices (like cameras or Wi‑Fi access points) might go, check cabling needs, and discuss your requirements.
         In short, you’re paying for a thorough, no-nonsense evaluation of your site. The result is an accurate quote with everything clearly laid out – no guesswork, no surprises. 
         You’ll know exactly what you’re getting and what it will cost.
        </p>

        <h3>Long version</h3>
        <ul class="small-note" style="margin:0; padding-left:18px;">
          <p>
            Why do we charge $75 for a site survey? Because our on-site assessment is real work – it’s not a free “walk-and-talk” where someone strolls around and gives a vague guess. For $75, we provide a professional service that delivers value. Here’s what happens during that assessment fee visit:
          </p>
          <li>Travel & Time: We drive to your location (covering gas and travel time) and devote dedicated time (often 20–60 minutes) solely to your project. 
            We don’t rush in and out – we make sure we understand the space and the challenges.</li>
          <li>Full Walkthrough: We walk through your entire space – be it a office, shop. 
            or warehouse (this does not include any quotes without an on-site visit.) – and inspect your current setup. 
            We peek into networking closets, check existing Wi‑Fi signals, look at where your cameras (if any) are, and note any potential issues (like weak Wi‑Fi areas or outdated wiring).</li>
          <li>Planning Device Placement: As we walk around, we identify where new devices should go. 
            For example, we figure out the best spots to mount security cameras for proper coverage, and where to put Wi‑Fi access points for strong signal. 
            We also determine if new cabling or drilling is needed for those spots.</li>
          <li>Detailed Q&A: Most importantly, we ask a lot of detailed questions – and we actually listen to your answers. 
            This helps us design a solution that fits you. Some of the key questions we typically ask include:</li>
            <li>Areas need security camera coverage?</li>
            <li>video quality and range do you expect from the cameras?</li>
            <li>Do you need Wi‑Fi coverage in all areas (any current dead spots)?</li>
            <li>How many people or devices will be using the internet at the same time?</li>
            <li>What internet speed do you have or need from your provider?</li>
          <li>…and that’s just the beginning. Depending on your situation, we’ll dive into many more specifics – for instance, do you need to store camera recordings (and for how long), do you want remote access to view cameras or systems when you’re off-site, or do you require backup systems (redundancy) to keep things running if something fails. We tailor these follow-up questions to cover every technical detail that matters to you.</li>
          <li>Explanation: Throughout the survey, we keep it straightforward and jargon-free. If something is important, we’ll explain it clearly. If something isn’t needed, we’ll tell you that too. The goal is to educate you about your options while gathering the info we need. We respect your time and intelligence – no fluff.</li>
          <li>Clear, Detailed Quote: After the on-site assessment, we take all the info gathered and build a comprehensive quote. This quote isn’t a one-liner or rough guess – it will clearly lay out every recommended device, every installation step, and the total cost. You’ll see line by line what you’d be paying for, so you can make an informed decision. Nothing is hidden or glossed over.</li>
          <p>
            In plain terms: the $75 fee makes sure the job is done right. It compensates for our travel and time, but more importantly it ensures we can focus on your needs in detail. We don’t offer free half-hour walkthroughs because those often miss important details, leading to sloppy quotes and nasty surprises later. Instead, we charge a modest fee and give you a professional-grade survey. By investing that small amount upfront, you’re getting peace of mind that the plan we provide will be solid.
          </p>
          <p>
            We understand $75 is an investment, so we make it worth every dollar. You get our undivided attention and honest expertise. In the end, you’ll have a tailored action plan for your network or security system. Whether you decide to move forward with our services or not, you’ll at least walk away with valuable insights about your space and a clear blueprint of what needs to be done.
          </p>
          <p>
            This isn’t just a “walk and chat” – it’s a professional on-site assessment. You’re paying for our knowledge, time, and thorough planning. In return, you get a through evaluation of your tech needs and a quote you can trust. We charge for it because it delivers real value to you.
